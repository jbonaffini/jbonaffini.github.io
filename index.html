I produced this webpage using Github pages and the use of <a class="catagory-link" style="font-weight: bold" href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>,
a webpage management API compatible with Github pages.  This Jekyll layout is my customized version of
<a class="catagory-link" style="font-weight: bold" href="https://fongandrew.github.io/hydeout/">Hydeout, built by Andrew Fong</a> as a version of the
original <a class="catagory-link" style="font-weight: bold" href="https://hyde.getpoole.com/">Jekyll Hyde Layout</a>.
