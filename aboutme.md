Hi, I'm James Bonaffini, a Biomedical Engineer aspiring to a fulfilling life by learning always,
challenging myself to new experiences, and applying my skills in
clinical product design for the greatest patient impact.<br><br>

I grew up and went school in the Northern Virginia area.  I attended college
at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, a city that I would
grow to love.  My 1st year, I lived in old dorms, located at the center of
grounds, where I made friends that remain among my best today.  I took classes
in the engineering department and chose to focus in Biomedical Engineering (BME).  
I also chose to enroll in Computer Science and Signal Processing courses since these
topics were applicable in the BME field and in the research lab that I worked as
an undergrad.  
<br> <br>
After graduating from UVA in 2015, I secured a job at Lockheed Martin in Northern
Virginia as a Systems Engineer and worked on a variety of legacy and modern systems.  
After working for several years, I left LM in the summer of 2018 to find my
next career step.  I planned a month-long backpacking trip in the Sierra
Mountain Range, hiking the 200+ mile <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Muir_Trail">John Muir Trail</a> with one of my best

friends from UVA.  Upon my return, I set to work learning other technologies
of interest, including machine learning and python, while applying to
jobs in the BME field.  In December 2018, I received an email from my alma mater
about a new Masters Program focusing on applied Clinical Engineering.  I submitted an application
and was chosen to attend.  I started the program in the summer of 2019 and was
afforded opportunities to observe clinicians in the UVA hospital and meet with hospital administrators.  The program
director, Dr. Jonathan Rosen, also mentored me and the rest of the program members
in the product development pipeline.  I, along with my program teammate, focused on the
Renal Continuum of Care, a field that is rapidly changing due to the Executive Order
regarding <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2019/07/10/hhs-launches-president-trump-advancing-american-kidney-health-initiative.html">Advancing American Kidney Health (AAKH)</a> signed in July 2019.  The Fall 2019
semester was devoted to identifying all of the issues in Renal Care through observation.  In the spring of 2020,
my teammate and I started designing a product meant to mitigate the incidence of
infection in Peritoneal Dialysis (PD) patients, since many patients will be transitioning
to home PD due to the AAKH Executive Order.
<br><br>
During the summer of 2020, I worked as an Engineering design intern at Luminoah, a new
startup in Charlottesville focusing on Enteral Nutrition technologies.  I will
finish my program after the Fall 2020 semester at UVA, after rounding out some of
the design, data science, and engineering skills that are most relevant in Clinical
Engineering. I hope to open my life's next chapter by utilizing my skills to make the greatest
patient-focused impact in the medical product industry.
